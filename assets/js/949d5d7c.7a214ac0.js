Its objective is to validate\u2014under real operational conditions\u2014the technical, organisational and economic capabilities required to deploy an energy data space aligned with European principles of data sovereignty, decentralised governance and cross-territorial interoperability.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"agriculture-landing":{"id":"agriculture-landing","title":"Data Spaces for the Energy Sector and Smart Cities","description":"Data Spaces for the Energy Sector and Smart Cities","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"compute-to-data":{"id":"compute-to-data","title":"Compute-to-Data (C2D)","description":"Compute-to-Data lets algorithms run close to the data without moving data out of its control domain. Instead of downloading the dataset, the algorithm \u201cvisits\u201d a secure data room, processes information, and only returns results (metrics, aggregates, trained models).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"gaiax-standards":{"id":"gaiax-standards","title":"Gaia-X standards and interoperability","description":"Gaia-X defines a trust and interoperability framework to federate data spaces across sectors and countries. Its building blocks (self-descriptions, verifiable credentials, federated catalogs, compliance services, data usage agreements, etc.) let independent organizations collaborate while preserving data sovereignty.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"governance":{"id":"governance","title":"Empower-X Governance Model","description":"1\\\\. General Principles","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"market-policy":{"id":"market-policy","title":"Marketplace access policies (policy.json)","description":"In data and service marketplaces (Ocean / Ocean Enterprise), each asset can define its usage rules via declarative policies (e.g., policy.json). These policies determine who can buy/consume, under which conditions, and with what level of access.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ocean-protocol-market":{"id":"ocean-protocol-market","title":"Ocean Protocol, marketplace and IPFS","description":"Ocean Protocol enables marketplaces for data and AI services with smart contracts and a flexible permission system. Assets (datasets, algorithms) are published with metadata, policies, and pricing; file references can live on IPFS or private origins.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ontologies":{"id":"ontologies","title":"Ontologies and Smart Data Models","description":"Ontologies provide agreed vocabularies to describe data in a uniform, machine\u2011readable way. In a data space, this eases integration across heterogeneous sources, advanced querying, and algorithm reuse.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"use-cases":{"id":"use-cases","title":"Developing Use Cases in Energy Data Spaces","description":"Data spaces enable the creation of collaborative solutions where different actors in the energy, urban and mobility ecosystem can combine data, algorithms and services within a shared framework of trust. This section explains how use cases are designed and deployed within the Empower-X ecosystem, following a practical, results-oriented methodology aligned with European principles of interoperability, data sovereignty and federated architectures.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"verifiable-credentials":{"id":"verifiable-credentials","title":"Verifiable Credentials and Gaia-X","description":"Verifiable Credentials (VCs) let holders prove attributes or facts (e.g., legal identity, roles, compliance) in a cryptographically secure way, verifiable without contacting the issuer, and under the holder\u2019s control. In Gaia-X, VCs and signed Self-Descriptions underpin the trust framework to identify participants, datasets, and services.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
