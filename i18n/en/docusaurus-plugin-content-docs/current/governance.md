# RegenAg-X Governance Model

## 1. General Principles

RegenAg-X is built on an **Organizational Governance** model designed to coordinate decision-making, define strategic and operational objectives, and ensure effective collaboration across all stakeholders involved in the data space.

A **Data Space Authority** is established as the entity responsible for operating and maintaining this governance framework, managing participant onboarding, handling disputes, and ensuring rule compliance.  
**Zertifier** will act as the **Data Space Authority** throughout the entire demonstrator phase.

As the ecosystem matures, the governance model will progressively evolve toward a **shared governance structure**, where farmers, cooperatives, technology providers and research organizations participate actively in decision-making. In later phases, options for establishing a neutral and sustainable long-term governance entity will be explored.

## 2. Data Sharing Governance

Data Sharing Governance regulates access to datasets, services, algorithms and compute capabilities inside the data space.

As the Data Space Authority, **Zertifier** will:

* define the initial participation criteria,  
* set the rules for publishing datasets and services,  
* supervise usage policies and access permissions,  
* ensure compliance with the European regulatory framework (GDPR, DGA) and national regulations.

**Initial Participants**

The initial participants are:

* the **Tech4RegenAg consortium members**, and  
* the **farmers and cooperatives involved in the Azores (Portugal) pilot projects**.

These participants have already expressed formal support through letters of intent and operational agreements.

New participants will be prioritised based on:

* complementarity with existing use cases,  
* potential for new high-value data space use cases,  
* ability to exploit data sovereignty mechanisms via **Compute-to-Data**,  
* and contributions with strong monetization or interoperability potential.

---

## 3. Rules for Data and Service Sharing

All resources published inside the data space must:

* be aligned with the agrifood domain,  
* comply with the European regulatory framework,  
* include clear and machine-readable policies,  
* support traceability through Web3 and distributed ledger technologies.

Usage policies will define:

* who can access a resource,  
* under which conditions,  
* with which algorithms,  
* and with what reuse restrictions.

## 4. Two-Level Governance Structure

The governance of RegenAg-X operates at two complementary levels:

### 4.1. Global Governance

Global Governance is defined by the **Ocean Enterprise Collective**, which establishes:

* interoperability rules across connected data spaces,  
* standards for secure computation and Compute-to-Data,  
* verification and auditability through Web3 credentials and ledgers,  
* alignment with the **Gaia-X Trust Framework** for federated data sharing.

Global governance is shared by the “federators” — the entities operating or participating in interconnected data spaces.

Zertifier also participates in Gaia-X governance forums, ensuring alignment with European specifications and open components for data-space federation.

### 4.2. RegenAg-X Governance (demonstrator level)

This level defines how the RegenAg-X demonstrator is operated and managed.

**Main Roles**

* **Ecosystem Promoter:**  
  **Zertifier**, responsible for defining the governance framework, managing onboarding/offboarding, and coordinating operations.  
* **Data Space Authority:**  
  **Zertifier**, ensuring compliance, dispute resolution and operational continuity.  
* **Data Space Operators:**  
  * Zertifier (Web3, verifiable identities, marketplace, smart-contract governance)  
  * Compute-to-Data and Data Room providers meeting DGA-aligned requirements  
    (Open to any infrastructure provider fulfilling the technical and regulatory guarantees.)  
* **Providers and Consumers:**  
  Tech4RegenAg consortium members and the Azores pilot farmers, with future expansion based on the demonstrator’s needs.

**Indirect Governance Actors**

Key open-source communities whose components underpin RegenAg-X:

* Gaia-X  
* Ocean Enterprise Collective  
* Ocean Protocol  
* Eclipse Dataspace Components (EDC)

These communities provide shared interoperability, security and semantic tooling for federated data spaces.

## 5. Organizational Model

RegenAg-X adopts a **network-based organizational model**, characterised by:

* consensus-driven collaboration,  
* reciprocity in data and service exchange,  
* collective benefit as a guiding principle.

The governance will evolve through three stages:

1. **Leadership Governance (initial phase)**  
   Zertifier acts as the central authority and coordinator.  
2. **Shared Governance (maturing phase)**  
   Participants progressively assume decision-making responsibilities.  
3. **Neutral Governance Entity (long-term phase)**  
   Participants may decide to establish a **Network Administrative Organization (NAO)** or equivalent neutral body.

## 6. Leadership Governance Model (initial demonstrator phase)

During the funded demonstrator phase, RegenAg-X will operate under a **Leadership Governance Model**, with Zertifier coordinating all governance tasks.

### 6.1. Organisational Interoperability

* Open admission to any agrifood actor meeting technical requirements.  
* Priority for participants who strengthen existing use cases or enable new ones.

### 6.2. Business Models

* Business autonomy through **smart contract–based agreements**.  
* Providers and consumers independently set prices, conditions and permissions.

### 6.3. Inter-Data-Space Interoperability

* Native connection to the **Ocean Enterprise Collective federated network**.  
* Cross-sector and multi-data-space interoperability aligned with Gaia-X specifications.

### 6.4. Semantic Interoperability

* Service and data descriptions using Gaia-X Trust Framework vocabularies.  
* Use of sector-specific and FAIR-aligned standards.  
* Ontology-based resource definitions.

### 6.5. Data Sovereignty

* Usage policies based on Ocean Enterprise smart-contract templates.  
* Progressive integration with Gaia-X policy languages.  
* Fine-grained control over access and algorithm execution.

### 6.6. Formats

* Use of W3C **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** for identities, datasets and services.  
* Interoperable metadata models across all components.

### 6.7. Compliance

* Conformance ensured using services compatible with the **Gaia-X Digital Clearing House (GXDC)** or equivalent verification services.

### 6.8. Technical Interoperability

* Architecture based on digital data federation.  
* Use of open-source components from the Ocean Enterprise and Gaia-X ecosystems.  
* Guaranteed data sovereignty, traceability and end-to-end auditability.
