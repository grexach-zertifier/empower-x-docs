# Cases

Explore how teams apply the project in different contexts. Our Empower-X energy dataspace is already deployed for the integration, traceability, and analysis of energy data in the Positive Energy District (PED) of Rubí (Catalonia, Spain). Here you will find cards per district/service with access to datasets, algorithms, and granular access policies, all under data sovereignty and with Compute-to-Data.

            This use case describes how the Rubí PED project plans flexibility, shared self-consumption, and 100% renewable charging by integrating public buildings, municipal photovoltaics, charging points, energy communities, and climate sensors. Through Empower-X, actors share data under common governance and execute algorithms via Compute-to-Data to enable real-time prediction, ZEAC calculation, digital twin simulation, surplus optimization, and coordinated flexibility management, with access to energy, climate, and mobility datasets, forecasting and certification algorithms, Web3 policies, and DLT auditing.
